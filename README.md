# PokePosts
An iPhone app for crowd-sourced Pokemon locations

Right now the app only has UI elements. Here is what they are:

1. A scrollable TableView that is custom made with a text element, voting system and even small map view.
  -The voting system allows for a downvote or upvote.
  -The text element corresponds with the post on the MapView.
  -The small map view has not been implemented yet but does slow things up a bit.
2. A MapView that has the ability to bring up a post limited to 140 characters.

Right now there is no server-side implementation, but the plan is to work on that after cleaning up the UI a bit.
